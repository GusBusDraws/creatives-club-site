      <h1>Welcome to Creatives Club!</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">
        A group for creatives of all types
      </div>
      <p>
        Creatives Club DC provides a space for creatives in the DMV to meet
        other like-minded folks and socialize while working on projects.
        Typically people bring their own things to work on, but there are
        always people looking for others to collaborate with! The club has a
        free & open meetup every Thursday from 6 - 9 pm, most often on the
        National Mall near the Smithsonian Metro station or at the MLK
        library.
